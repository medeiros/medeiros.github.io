Hello. My name is Daniel Medeiros. I'm a 37 years old Software
Engineer from SÃ£o Paulo area, Brazil.

I was one of those kids that discovered programming soon. My first programming languages were Clipper 5 and QBasic, running with DOS 5 and Windows 3.11 in a IBM PC AT 386 hardware. A lot of languages, hardwares and operational systems have been passed ever since, and I'm very grateful for all that computer experience and the growing passion in coding which all that experience brought.

Recently, I attended my Master Degree in Software Engineering, whose thesis is related to Scrum adoption in large enterprises. My approach to software engineering is definitely not just technical-related. The idea to integrate technical aspects of computing with the human side, in terms of people interactions in teamwork, is a subject that always interested me. This approach is also in accordance with my personality type - an INFJ. Psychology and philosophy are two other disciplines that I have in higher account. Everything related to structures of mind fascinates me, making me a heavy user of appliance of conceptual and mind maps. As a matter of fact, I created a conceptual map to define the structure and purpose of this site, that you can find below:

My true passion remains to build and optimize things in terms of code. Currently, my interests are focused on microservices and elastic search architectures, along with Continuous Integration approaches, and I've been also programming in Clojure in my spare time.

I'm currently working as consultant in architecture and agile methods. I think this kind of work fits me well, because allows me to work in - and learn - new technical aspects and bring that specialization to people in companies, in a way that optimize and simplify their work. I love to teach and mentor, and it's my plan to became an university professor in a near future.

I enjoy history in general, and more specifically medieval and celtic themes. The name of this domain site, "arneam", is a contraction of <em>ar neahm</em>, an celtic term that means "from the sky".
