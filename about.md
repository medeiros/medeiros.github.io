<h4>Hello there!</h4>
</p>

Hello. My name is Daniel Medeiros. I'm a Software Engineer from São Paulo area, Brazil.

Software development came early in my life - more specifically when I was 12 years old, in the early 90's. Clipper 5 and QBasic were some my first programming languages, running on top of DOS 5 and Windows 3.11 in a IBM PC AT 386 hardware. A lot of languages, hardwares and operational systems have passed ever since, and I'm still very satisfied to have chosen a carreer in software engineering.

My true passion is to optimize things in terms of code, with my main subjects of interest in software engineering related to programming and architecture of distributed applications. Currently, I'm working as architect/developer in a small team, being responsible for architecture, design and construction of a multi-tier web application/batch processing solution, processing thousands of records per day under performance constraints, using technologies such as Java8, Spring Batch, Univocity parser, Oracle database, REST/SOAP integrations and linux shell scripting. Beyond that, my efforts are also focused on microservices and REST APIs, and I've been also studying and working on projects of personal interest in my spare time.

My preferred approach to work on the field is strategic, organized and disciplined, giving room for technical creativity while considering the constraints of deadlines and business commitments. Since my personality type is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ" target="_blank">INFJ</a>, it is natural for me to deal well with people of my team and to be aware of the big picture in terms of project execution.

I also like history in general, and more specifically medieval and celtic themes. The name of this domain site, "arneam", is a contraction of <em>ar neahm</em>, an scottish gaelic term that means something like "from heaven".
