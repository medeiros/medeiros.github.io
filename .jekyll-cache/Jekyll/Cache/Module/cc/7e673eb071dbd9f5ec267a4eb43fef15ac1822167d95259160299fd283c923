    <p>Thoughts about microservice usage in 2017.</p>

<ul class="large-only" id="markdown-toc">

</ul>

<p>Today, I watched the Sam Neilâ€™s video <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-would-you-use-microservices">â€œWhy would you use microservices?â€</a>. Itâ€™s a very nice summarization of what microservices are and their value to adoption in organizations. Key points that I found particularly interesting are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small teams, responsible for its own codebase (restricted to the team domain(s)), perform better and are happier;</li>
  <li>People are talking a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway Law</a> in recent times. The idea that the architecture evolves with the organization, however, seems a little bit romantic in my opinion;</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>organizations which design systems â€¦ are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations â€”â€‰M. Conway</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>The good and old scenario of having to change a single line in a monolith and then stop and redeploy the entire application seems more and more absurd;</li>
  <li>The suggested book <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Art-Scalability-Architecture-Organizations-Enterprise/dp/0134032802">â€œThe Art of Scalabilityâ€</a> seems pretty much interesting, since is a very important topic in the regards of microservices archutectural style;</li>
  <li>The three axis presented (<em>â€œHorizontal Duplicationâ€</em>, <em>â€œData Partitioningâ€</em> and <em>â€œFunctional Decomposition - Microservicesâ€</em>) are a perfect concept. Those three items are recurrent problems when we continuosly have to deal when handling with modularization of different domains in a physical level.
    <ul>
      <li>In the regards of <em>â€œFunctional Decompositionâ€</em>, it is nice to figure that DDD patterns (thinking of code in terms of business domain) <em>finally</em> finds its place. <strong>Bounded Context</strong> are one of the patterns to adopt in order to achieve functional decomposition. Hope people value <strong>Eric Evans</strong> work now.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The idea that each part of the application can scale independently gives a lot of flexibility to infrastructure people (DevOps, if you can do it). Add <em>Docker</em> to all this and you have a lot of exciting and interesting material to study and work for several years!
    <blockquote>
      <p>Itâ€™s a nice time to work in applicationsâ€™ infrastructure</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Adopt different technologies easier: this is also great. Thanks to API, there is flexibility to develop microservices using your preferred tools and technologies. For instance, it would be nice to get a bunch of enthusiastic, self-taught people to develop a specific Clojure/Datomic microservice to gather some banking account data without the hassle of hear something like: â€œthis is not the official language of the company; weâ€™re not able to train all developers of the company to code in Clojure!â€
    <ul>
      <li>It was nice and surprising that Sam talked in the video about Clojure in the same viewpoint I also consider (<em>â€œthe next best thingâ€</em>) :D</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="more-information">More information</h2>

<p>This video is great. Besides it, there are also a lot of informative content regarding this subject that I have been gathering and studying. I liked a lot the very instructive Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/microservices-with-spring-cloud/learn/v4/">â€œMicroservices with Spring Cloudâ€</a>, along with the readings: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1491950358">â€œBuilding Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systemsâ€</a> (from the same author of this video) (Amazon), <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/microservices-in-production.csp">â€œMicroservices in Productionâ€</a> from Susan Fowler (Free) and <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/migrating-an-esb-to-a-cloud-native-platform">â€œMigrating and ESB to a Cloud-Native Platformâ€</a> from Pivotal (Free White paper).</p>

<p>They are all very nice materials to start learning microservices.</p>
