<p>Trello is an awesome tool to keep tasks being executed. One of the cool features
of this tool is the labeling of cards. However, there is no way no natively
show label’s text (only colors are displayed). In this post I’ll show how to
do this with Chrome plugins.</p>

<p>Trello allows you to keep your tasks organized, providing a board with nice
features. One feature that would be nice to have is the ability to show, in
the board, the names of the labels (since only show the colors are not
enough).</p>

<p>There is a Chrome plugin that can show the title in the labels, directly in
the board. The steps are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type, in your chrome bar: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome://extensions/</code></li>
  <li>click in ‘Obtain more extensions’ (or something like that); it will lead
you to the Chrome Web Store</li>
  <li>search for “Card Color Titles for Trello”</li>
  <li>Install it and open your Trello board. Check to see that your labels now contains related text.</li>
</ul>
