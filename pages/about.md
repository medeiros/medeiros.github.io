Hello. My name is Daniel Medeiros. I'm a Software Engineer from SÃ£o Paulo area, Brazil.

Software development came early in my life - more specifically during my 12-14 years old, in the early 90's. Clipper 5 and QBasic where the first programming languages, running on top of DOS 5 and Windows 3.11 in a IBM PC AT 386 hardware. A lot of languages, hardwares and operational systems have passed ever since, and I'm still very satisfied to have chosen a carreer in this same field of knowledge.

Recently I attended my master degree, whose thesis is related to Scrum adoption in large enterprises. So we can conclude that my approach to software engineering is not simply technical-related, which is accurate. The idea to integrate technical aspects of computing with the human side, in terms of people interactions and teamwork, is a subject that always makes sense to me. This sort of thinking is also in accordance with my personality type - an INFJ (psychology and philosophy are two other disciplines that I have in higher account, since everything related to structures of mind fascinates me). Thus, my preferred approach to perform work is strategic, organized and disciplined, giving room for technical creativity while considering the constraints of deadlines and business commitments.

My true passion continues to be optimize things in terms of code, with my main subjects of interest in software engineering related to programming and architecture of web applications. Currently, my interests are focused on microservices and REST APIs, along with continuous integration and provisioning, and I've been also programming in Clojure, doing courses and working on project of personal interest in my spare time. I keep a personal timebox of 4 months in order to execute and conclude my projects, gather feedback from experience, and then start all over again.

I'm currently working as consultant of architecture and agile methods. I think this kind of work fits me well, because allows me to work in - and learn - new technical aspects and bring that specialization to people in companies, in a way that optimize and simplify their work. My mission as professional would be "to bring knowledge and practical application of modern technologies to people and organizations". I enjoy to teach and mentor, and it's my plan to became an university professor in the future.

I also like history in general, and more specifically medieval and celtic themes. The name of this domain site, "arneam", is a contraction of <em>ar neahm</em>, an scottish gaelic term that means somthing like "from heaven".
